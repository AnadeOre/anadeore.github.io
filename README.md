I'm Ana E. de Orellana a maths PhD student at the University of St Andrews, supervised by [Jonathan Fraser](https://jonathan-fraser.github.io/homepage/) and [Kenneth Falconer](https://kennethfalconer.github.io). I completed my undergraduate studies in mathemathics at the Universidad Nacional del Litoral, in Argentina.

My research interests are in dimension theory. Specifically, in the connection between geometric measure theory and Fourier analysis through the Fourier spectrum. See [arxiv](http://arxiv.org/a/deorellana_a_1) for a complete list of my preprints.

I'm the creator behind the [Problemathic YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/problemathic) and [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/problemathicvideos/). In addition to this, my hobbies include having small [programming projects](https://animaths.vercel.app), mostly in web development.
