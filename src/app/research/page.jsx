        While the Hausdorff dimension of a set gives information regarding its
        geometric scaling properties, the Fourier dimension quentifies how
        structured vs how random that set is. For example, the Cantor set (very
        algebraically structured) has Fourier dimension zero, but random sets
        are usually Salem sets, i.e. their Fourier dimension is as large as it
        can be, being equal to their Hausdorff dimension.
        <br />
        In these situations, where we have two dimensions that capture different
        types of information, dimension interpolation is useful to gain insight
        on their relation. I'm currently studying the Fourier spectrum, a family
        of dimensions that live between the Fourier and the Hausdorff dimensions
        for sets and Fourier and Sobolev dimensions for measures.

          abstract="Marstrand's celebrated projection theorem gives the Hausdorff dimension of the orthogonal projection of a Borel set in Euclidean space for almost all orthogonal projections. It is straightforward to see that sets for which the Fourier and Hausdorff dimension coincide have no exceptional projections, that is, all orthogonal projections satisfy the conclusion of Marstrand's theorem. With this in mind, one might believe that the Fourier dimension (or at least, Fourier decay) could be used to give better estimates for the Hausdorff dimension of the exceptional set in general. We obtain projection theorems and exceptional set estimates based on the Fourier spectrum; a family of dimensions that interpolates between the Fourier and Hausdorff dimensions. We apply these results to show that the Fourier spectrum can be used to improve several results for the Hausdorff dimension in certain cases, such as Ren--Wang's sharp bound for the exceptional set in the plane, Peres--Schlag's exceptional set bound and Bourgain--Oberlin's sharp 0-dimensional exceptional set estimate."

          abstract='The Fourier spectrum is a family of dimensions that interpolates between the Fourier and Hausdorff dimensions and are defined in terms of certain energies which capture Fourier decay. In this paper we obtain a convenient discrete representation of those energies using the Fourier coefficients. As an example application, we use this representation to establish sharp bounds for the Fourier spectrum of a general measure with bounded support, improving previous estimates of the second-named author.'
